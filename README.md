# GAget for OS X Dashboard
GAget for Dashboard has been an OS X Dashboard widget for Google Analytics. The project has been abandoned in 2015 due to the following reasons:
- Google depricated the ClientLogin API for user authentication. The OAuth2 method would take a significant amount of time to implement properly to fit the user experience of a simple Dashboard widget.
- Apple has not released an update to Dashcode in many years (last update was in 2012). This app was the developer tool for Dashboard widgets (just like Xcode is for native apps). Since it's not been updated, you can't develop Dashboard widgets with it.

You can try to overcome the above issues and make a pull request, I'll gladly update it and promote a working widget on all social channels. :)
